        <p>Yesterday, I spent my last few hours in the western world for a while, watched the sunset over Africa from a plane, and landed in the country I will call home for the next 27 months.</p>
        <p>Today, I successfully used the kind of bathroom I’ll be using here. &nbsp;I’m assuming (and hoping) that that will get easier with time.</p>
        <p>We received the most amazing welcome upon arriving in Mali. &nbsp;Many of the Peace Corps Response Volunteers that are serving here currently came to meet us at the airport to meet us and screamed and cheered for us as we came out of the airport. &nbsp;They made us ridiculous signs and the staff took a bunch of photos. &nbsp;This was not only an exciting day for us, it was an exciting day for Peace Corps Mali and Mali, as we are the first group of volunteers to return after the coup d’etat that lead to the evacuation of all the volunteers and a suspension of the program in <img data-attachment-id="13" data-permalink="https://hotamali.wordpress.com/2015/07/20/fall-in-love-with-mali-as-quickly-as-you-can-as-much-as-you-can/img_0510/" data-orig-file="https://hotamali.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/img_0510.jpg" data-orig-size="5184,3456" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;7.1&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS M&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1434329135&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;18&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.008&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="IMG_0510" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://hotamali.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/img_0510.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://hotamali.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/img_0510.jpg?w=842" class="size-medium wp-image-13 alignright" src="https://hotamali.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/img_0510.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200" alt="IMG_0510" srcset="https://hotamali.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/img_0510.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https://hotamali.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/img_0510.jpg?w=600&amp;h=400 600w, https://hotamali.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/img_0510.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" width="300" height="200">Mali in April of 2012. &nbsp;Although it’s scary to be in a place that isn’t the safest, it is incredible to be a part of this group. &nbsp;Everyone; volunteers, trainers, directors and language instructors are all overwhelmingly happy to see the program starting up again.</p>
        <p>In case you’re new, I’m currently in Mali volunteering with the Peace Corps. &nbsp;Mali is a country in West Africa that was under French colonial rule until relatively recently, and has a rich Islamic culture. &nbsp;Mali is also very, very hot. &nbsp;And dusty. &nbsp;It’s also full of bright, beautiful and ornate fabrics (and people).</p>
        <p>I’ll be working as a Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Extension Agent her for 24 months (assuming I pass all my qualifications during pre-service training). &nbsp;That also means I’ll be spending the 10 or so weeks trying to shove my brain full of as much information as possible. &nbsp;I’ll be learning how to wash my own clothes, how to speak Bambara, how to dig/build a well, all about Malian culture and customs, about pre-natal nutrition, hopefully how to speak some French, and most importantly how to live in this country, and how to love it.</p>

        <p>I’ll spend my first three months at my site, doing what’s called a focused needs assessment. &nbsp;Which means I’ll be trying to figure out what my host village needs, so I can return to Tubaniso to get very specific training on whatever technical skills I’ll need.</p>
        <p>I’ve been given some really excellent advice over the years as I’ve been contemplating, applying, and waiting to serve in the Peace Corps. &nbsp;The one I’m focusing on now is from our Country Desk Officer: “Fall in love with Mali. &nbsp;As quickly as you can, as much as you can.”</p>
