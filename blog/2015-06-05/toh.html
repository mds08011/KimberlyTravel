    <h2>Toh</h2>
		<p>Toh is one of the staple foods here in Mali. &nbsp;It involves pounding either millet or corn (millet in most of Mali, but often corn in the Sikasso region) into powder, then adding water and cooking it until it forms a thick paste. &nbsp;Its then spooned into a communal bowl where it semi-solidifies. &nbsp;It is eaten with your right hand, and coupled with a few different kinds of sauces. &nbsp;If you’re lucky, you get a red, kind of spicy sauce. &nbsp;And if you’re unlucky, you get a green okra sauce, that has the same texture and consistency as snot (and the same taste if you ask some of my fellow volunteers).</p>
        <p>Toh is incredibly easy to make, can easily be reheated (for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!), and inexpensive (because most people in Mali are&nbsp;subsistence farmers). &nbsp;But it’s also boring to eat, and not as nutritious as people need it to be.</p>
        <p>One of the things I will be working on here, is education about food diversity and food groups. &nbsp;I’ll probably spend the next two years being malnourished, and yet I’m expected to teach others how to eat better.</p>
