    <h2>About</h2>       
    <p>My name is Kadia Bagayogo (or Kimberly Sultz if you’re living in America), and I am living in rural Mali for the next 27 months. &nbsp;If you’re hip, you’ve probably already guessed I’m in the Peace Corps. &nbsp;Come here to see how I reflect on my experience, and learn about one of the richest cultures in the world.</p>
