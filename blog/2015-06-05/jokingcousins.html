    <h2>Joking Cousins</h2>    
    <p>For the last 700 plus years, the Malians have had one consistent joke. &nbsp;That joke is: “you eat beans.” &nbsp;Those three words are used in presidential speeches, to stop arguments, and almost anytime you meet someone new.</p>
        <p>If you don’t already know, I took a Malian name for my stay here. &nbsp;My first name is Kadia (one of the wives of the prophet), and while I was at home-stay, my last name was Diarra. &nbsp;Now, at site, I chose to take my new host family’s last name: Bagayogo (which means blacksmith). &nbsp;I know that volunteers around the world probably use other names during their stay, but here in Mali, a Malian last name is essential to our integration because of the joking cousins relationship.</p>
        <p>Depending on your last name (or ethnic group in areas where your last name is not as recognized), you automatically have a joking relationship with people with specific last names. &nbsp;For example, when I was a Diarra, I joked with Traore’s and Coulibaly’s. &nbsp;That meant, that as soon as I learned their last name, I’d call them a bean eater. &nbsp;Or if I heard a donkey make a noise, I’d say it was the cry of a Traore. &nbsp;Now, as a Bagayogo, in my village, I joke with Samake’s, although that is mostly because that is really the only other last name in Faraguara. &nbsp;When I am in larger cities, I have few joking cousins, but still get a lot of comments about being hard-headed, or being asked to make things for people (all going back to the blacksmith origins of Bagayogo).</p>
        <p>It can get kind of confusing, but the best fall-back is always, “you eat beans,” or “you’re a bean-eater.” &nbsp;This is because Malians are very embarrassed by the idea of farting. &nbsp;If you ask a Malian if they’ve ever farted, they’ll almost always tell you no, they’ve never farted in their life. &nbsp;Beans make you fart, and farting is bad, so bean-eating is bad. &nbsp;Except Malians eat a whole lot of beans, regardless of what their last name is.</p>
        <p>All of this probably sounds pretty funny to you, which is good. &nbsp;But here, no conversation can exist without a bean joke. &nbsp;This means I have been called a bean-eater, and called others bean-eaters thousands of times since I’ve gotten here. &nbsp;It’s kind of getting old for me. &nbsp;But yet, this is the same joke that’s been used for the last 700 years, and the Malians always laugh at it, always. &nbsp;And what’s even more impressive, is that they use it to end arguments. &nbsp;I’ve seen more than one argument that started out venomous, and ended in peels of laughter when someone said “you eat beans.”</p>
